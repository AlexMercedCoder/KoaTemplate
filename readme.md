## KOA Template
#### by Alex Merced of AlexMercedCoder.com/devNursery.com

This template is ready out of the box for making RESTful APIS, other middleware you may want to add depending on what you are doing.

- koa-views if you want to use a view engine like EJS or PUG
- koa-jwt if you want to use JWT tokens
- koa-static for static serving files

This template should allow for:

- Creating routes
- Setting CORS settings
- Parsing JSON and URLENCODED DATA from request body
